Planning for Real World Project with below features

---

### **User Management and Authentication**
1. **Multi-Level User System**:
   - Implement `Group` and `Permission` models for role-based access (Admin, Staff, Client, etc.).
   - Custom user model with extendable fields (e.g., `UserProfile`).
   - JWT or OAuth authentication using `djangorestframework-simplejwt` or `django-oauth-toolkit`.

2. **Authentication**:
   - User registration with email/username.
   - Login/logout, password reset, and email verification.
   - Two-factor authentication (e.g., using `django-otp`).

3. **User Profiles**:
   - Create a profile model linked to the custom user.
   - API for updating and retrieving profile data.

### **Administrative Features**
4. **Admin Management**:
   - Admin APIs for managing users, roles, and permissions.
   - Admin dashboard stats API (e.g., total users, active sessions, etc.).

5. **Activity Logging**:
   - Middleware to log user activities like login, CRUD operations, etc.
   - Store logs in the database with APIs to view logs (filter by user, date, etc.).

### **Core Functionalities**
6. **Notification System**:
   - Send in-app and email notifications using Celery.
   - Using websocket for fetching notification count.
   - API for fetching user-specific notifications.

7. **Email Sending System**:
   - Use `django.core.mail` or `django-ses` for email functionality.
   - Email templates for user actions like registration, password reset, etc.
   - API to send custom emails (Admin-only).

8. **Product/Service Management**:
   - CRUD operations for products/services.
   - Models for categories, inventory, pricing, and orders.
   - APIs for searching, filtering, and listing products/services.

9. **Payment Integration**:
   - Integrate Stripe/PayPal for payment processing.
   - Models for transactions and payment history.
   - API for creating and verifying payments.

### **API Development**
10. **RESTful API**:
    - Use Django REST Framework for structured APIs.
    - Modular serializers for CRUD operations and nested relationships.

11. **API Authentication**:
    - Token-based authentication (JWT/OAuth).
    - Throttling for rate-limiting APIs.

12. **API Documentation**:
    - Generate Swagger/OpenAPI documentation using `drf-spectacular`.

---

### **Scalability and Optimization**
13. **Caching**:
    - Implement Redis or Memcached for caching expensive database queries.
    - Cache user-specific data (e.g., recently accessed items).

14. **Asynchronous Tasks**:
    - Use Celery with Redis for background processing.
    - Handle tasks like sending emails, report generation, or bulk data operations.

15. **Database Optimization**:
    - Write optimized queries for listing, filtering, and grouping.
    - Use Django ORM's `select_related` and `prefetch_related` for query optimization.

### **File Handling**
16. **File Uploads**:
    - Backend-only support for managing user uploads (e.g., profile pictures, documents).
    - Use cloud storage like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage for scalability. (Optional)

---

### **Testing and Validation**
17. **Validation**:
    - Use custom validators for fields (e.g., phone numbers, email).
    - Validate complex data structures in serializers.

18. **Testing**: (Optional)
    - Write unit tests for models, views, and APIs using `pytest-django`.
    - Include integration tests for key workflows (e.g., user registration).

---

### **Security**
19. **Security Measures**:
    - Enforce HTTPS and secure headers.
    - Protect against CSRF, XSS, and SQL injection.
    - Implement rate-limiting for sensitive APIs like login.

20. **Audit Trail**:
    - Maintain an audit log for critical changes like user updates, role changes, etc.

---

### **Advanced Features**
21. **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**:
    - APIs for dynamically managing permissions by role.
    - Example: Only admins can access the product creation API.

22. **Data Import/Export**:
    - Backend APIs to upload/download data in CSV or JSON formats.
    - Validation of imported data before saving.

23. **Analytics API**:
    - Generate reports like:
      - User registration trends.
      - Sales and revenue data.
    - Provide JSON responses for frontend visualizations.

---

### **Other Essential Features**
24. **Search and Filters**:
    - Full-text search using PostgreSQL.
    - API for querying with advanced filters (e.g., price range, category).

25. **Error Handling**:
    - Standardized error responses for all APIs.
    - Use custom exception handlers in DRF.
